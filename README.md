# Viola-Jones-Face_Detection
Viola-Jones implementation for human face-detection in Python. Only Python Standard libraries have been used for this project as the aim is to understand the underlying concept without importing library methods. Any APIs provided by OpenCV that have \cascade", \Cascade", \haar" or \Haar" func- tionality have not be used.
